</header>

<h3> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
</h3>
        <p1> My interest surrounding IT began when I left to live with my father in Iraq in 2012 for a couple of years. Having my mother and brother overseas, I became really interested in computers and the systems behind it as I had used it as a source of communication and liking. No one in my family was really into technology however seeing how applications such as Google Maps and websites such as eBay had been able to reach people all over the world, questions started to arise. How did all this become? I never really believed that Google Maps was just, simply and plainly Google Maps. That is where my interest in IT was sparked. I gained experience in IT when I applied for a two-week intern ship at ACONEX, a company providing mobile and web-based collaboration technologies for project information and process management, on a software as a service basis, to clients in all areas. Having two pc monitors, a laptop and a fully supplied desk, made my interest in IT grow more and more. I was assigned to code a tic tac toe game and even though it may be considered a simple code, at that time it felt good to achieve writing it. </p1>

<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
        <p1> I remember seeing RMIT university advertisements on the television when I was in year 9, the excitement I had was indescribable. Knowing that it is one of the highest qualified universities for IT made it even more the reason of choosing it to be the place in which I complete my degree. It is called the ‘Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology’ for a reason. I had also gone to the RMIT Melbourne city campus for VCE lectures held by ATAR Notes and the vibe this university gave made studying feel fun. Thus, I chose to apply and here I am today. </p1> 

 <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
        <p1> Studying at RMIT and choosing this specific course, I expect to learn about how technology works, the software and hardware of a pc and programming languages. I really hope to study about different languages such as java, python, c++ and many more. Understanding the basics of these will help me to develop applications, games and websites to assist me in my future career. I expect to learn enough to help me graduate with high scores so that I will know what I am doing when I do something related to IT. </p1>
